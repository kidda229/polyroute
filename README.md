## 📋 What is polyroute?

polyroute is a tool that helps you manage and send requests to multiple AI language models. It picks the best model to answer your questions, tries alternatives if one fails, and tracks how much you use each service. The app works quietly in the background and makes sure you get the best response without extra effort.

This program is useful for anyone who uses AI tools and wants a simple way to switch between different providers automatically. You don’t need to know anything about coding or setting up these services.
